Reset Password in Cisco ASA Firewall

Here are the steps to recover the password in Cisco ASA firewall,

Step 1: Login to Cisco ASA device with console cable and reboot the device. Power off the device and power it up back again.

Step 2: Press ‘ESC’ key or ‘BREAK’ key on the keyboard to break the boot process. Press the key as soon as the device starts. Press the key until the device gets into ROMMON mode. The prompt will look like this,

Cisco Systems ROMMON Version (1.0(12)13) #0: Thu Aug 28 15:55:27 PDT 2008

Platform ASA5505

Use BREAK or ESC to interrupt boot.
Use SPACE to begin boot immediately.
Boot interrupted.

Use ? for help.
rommon #0>
rommon #0>

As you can see rommon #> mode.

Step 3: Now, here is the trick. Type the following command to change the configuration register value to 0x41. This value instructs device to ignore the start-up config while the device boots up.

rommon #0> confreg 0x41

Update Config Register (0x41) in NVRAM...

rommon #1>

Step 4: Reboot the device. Type boot to do so.

rommon #1> boot

Step 5: When the ASA is booted, it will not ask for password. Before the ciscoasa> prompt you can see the message saying, start-up configured has been ignored. Type enable to get into privilege mode. In the password prompt, hit enter because the password is blank.

Ignoring startup configuration as instructed by configuration register.
